  abstract = {Introduction In January 2021, the UK decided to prioritise the delivery of the first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca) vaccines by extending the interval until the second dose up to 12 weeks. Methods Serological responses were compared after BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccination with varying intervals in uninfected and previously-infected adults aged 50-89 years. These findings are evaluated against real-world national vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against COVID-19 in England. Results We recruited 750 participants aged 50-89 years, including 126 (16.8\%) with evidence of previous infection; 421 received BNT162b2 and 329 and AZD1222. For both vaccines, over 95\% had seroconverted 35-55 days after dose one, and 100\% seroconverted 7+ days after dose 2. Following a 65-84 day interval between two doses, geometric mean titres (GMTs) at 14-34 days were 6-fold higher for BNT162b2 (6703; 95\%CI, 5887-7633) than AZD1222 (1093; 806-1483), which in turn were higher than those receiving BNT162b2 19-29 days apart (694; 540 - 893). For both vaccines, VE was higher across all age-groups from 14 days after dose two compared to one dose, but the magnitude varied with interval between doses. Higher two-dose VE was observed with {$>$}6 week intervals between BNT162b2 doses compared to the authorised 3-week schedule, including {$\geq$}80 year-olds. Conclusion Our findings support the UK approach of prioritising the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines, with evidence of higher protection following extended schedules. Given global vaccine constraints, these results are relevant to policymakers, especially with highly transmissible variants and rising incidence in many countries. Funding Public Health England},

  abstract = {Although clinical trials and real-world studies have affirmed the effectiveness and safety of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, reports of breakthrough infections and persistent emergence of new variants highlight the need to vigilantly monitor the effectiveness of these vaccines. Here we compare the effectiveness of two full-length Spike protein-encoding mRNA vaccines from Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) in the Mayo Clinic Health System over time from January to July 2021, during which either the Alpha or Delta variant was highly prevalent. We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86\%, 95\%CI: 81-90.6\%; BNT162b2: 76\%, 95\%CI: 69-81\%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6\%, 95\% CI: 81-97\%; BNT162b2: 85\%, 95\% CI: 73-93\%). In July, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81\%, 95\% CI: 33-96.3\%; BNT162b2: 75\%, 95\% CI: 24-93.9\%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76\%, 95\% CI: 58-87\%; BNT162b2: 42\%, 95\% CI: 13-62\%), with a more pronounced reduction for BNT162b2. Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7\% in May to over 70\% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85\% to 13\% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60\% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.24-0.62). Our observational study highlights that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly protect against infection and severe disease, further evaluation of mechanisms underlying differences in their effectiveness such as dosing regimens and vaccine composition are warranted.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of concern is expanding globally. Here, we assess real-world effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines against this variant in the population of Qatar, using a matched test-negative, case- control study design. BNT162b2 effectiveness against any Delta infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, was 64.2\% (95\% CI: 38.1-80.1\%) {$\geq$}14 days after the first dose and before the second dose, but was only 53.5\% (95\% CI: 43.9-61.4\%) {$\geq$}14 days after the second dose, in a population in which a large proportion of fully vaccinated persons received their second dose several months earlier. Corresponding effectiveness measures for mRNA-1273 were 79.0\% (95\% CI: 58.9-90.1\%) and 84.8\% (95\% CI: 75.9-90.8\%), respectively. Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to Delta was 89.7\% (95\% CI: 61.0-98.1\%) for BNT162b2 and 100.0\% (95\% CI: 41.2-100.0\%) for mRNA-1273, {$\geq$}14 days after the second dose. Both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are highly effective in preventing Delta hospitalization and death, but less so in preventing infection, particularly for BNT162b2.},
