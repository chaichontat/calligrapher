    The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants across the world has raised
    concerns about the effectiveness of available COVID-19 vaccines that were
    designed against the original Wuhan (wild type) variant. Critical questions
    have arisen regarding: (a) the effectiveness of various vaccines in
    preventing infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalization, intensive care
    unit (ICU) admission and death and (b) the magnitude and clinical
    consequences of post-vaccination infections in the context of emerging
    variants, especially the Delta variant of SARS-Cov2. While “real world”
    experiences with various vaccines have been reported, few have examined
    comparative effectiveness of various vaccines in one population, as new
    SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged.  Here we present an analysis of COVID-19
    related outcomes from Bahrain, a country with a total population of 1.501
    million, where four vaccines were deployed (total vaccinated =1,003,960),
    including Astra-Zeneca (AZ/Covishield), Pfizer/BioNtech, Sinopharm and
    Sputnik V. By analyzing individual histories of vaccinated versus
    unvaccinated cases, we provide a granular description of the effectiveness
    of the four vaccines, disease burden in unvaccinated versus vaccinated
    individuals over time, and the risk of four outcomes (infections,
    hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths) due to breakthrough infections
    among vaccinated individuals. We conclude that the four vaccines were
    effective in reducing all four outcomes in vaccinated compared to
    unvaccinated individuals, prior to, and during the period when the Delta
    variant became dominant in the country (May 2021 to the present). However,
    after censoring early vaccine recipients of Sinopharm vaccine, compared to
    Pfizer/BionTech recipients, individuals vaccinated with Sinopharm had a
    higher risk of post-vaccination infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions
    and deaths, especially in those &gt; 50 years old. Our overall findings
    support the value of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 related events even
    with the advent of the Delta variant. These data support the urgent need to
    expand vaccination access around the world, and may serve to guide the
    choice of vaccines in the context of the Delta variant.

    BACKGROUND: Waning of vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or
    COVID-19 disease is a concern. This study investigated persistence of
    BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine effectiveness against infection and
    disease in Qatar, where the Beta and Delta variants have dominated incidence
    and PCR testing is done at a mass scale. METHODS: A matched test-negative,
    case-control study design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against
    SARS-CoV-2 infection and against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19
    disease, between January 1, 2021 to August 15, 2021. RESULTS: Estimated
    BNT162b2 effectiveness against any infection, asymptomatic or symptomatic,
    was negligible for the first two weeks after the first dose, increased to
    36.5% (95% CI: 33.1-39.8) in the third week after the first dose, and
    reached its peak at 72.1% (95% CI: 70.9-73.2) in the first five weeks after
    the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually thereafter, with the
    decline accelerating ≥15 weeks after the second dose, reaching diminished
    levels of protection by the 20th week. Effectiveness against symptomatic
    infection was higher than against asymptomatic infection, but still waned in
    the same fashion. Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal
    disease increased rapidly to 67.7% (95% CI: 59.1-74.7) by the third week
    after the first dose, and reached 95.4% (95% CI: 93.4-96.9) in the first
    five weeks after the second dose, where it persisted at about this level for
    six months. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2-induced protection against infection
    appears to wane rapidly after its peak right after the second dose, but it
    persists at a robust level against hospitalization and death for at least
    six months following the second dose.

  abstract: >-
    Background: Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have
    begun to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred
    by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Methods: We conducted
    a retrospective observational study comparing three groups:
    (1)SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the
    BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals
    who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose
    vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were
    applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection,
    symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The
    follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was
    dominant in Israel. Results: SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold
    (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the
    Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event
    (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The
    increased risk was significant (P<0.001) for symptomatic disease as well.
    When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from
    March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was
    demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI,
    4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95%
    CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naive
    vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations
    compared to those that were previously infected. Conclusions: This study
    demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger
    protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused
    by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose
    vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with
    SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional
    protection against the Delta variant.

  abstract: >-
    Shortages of COVID-19 vaccines have results in delayed dosing intervals as a
    strategy to immunize a greater proportion of the population.&amp;nbsp;The
    effect of this strategy on vaccine immunogenicity is not well
    studied.&amp;nbsp;Humoral (anti-RBD levels and neutralization) and cellular
    immune responses were compared in health care workers receiving two doses of
    BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines at standard (3-6 week) and delayed (8-12
    week) intervals. In the delayed group, anti-RBD antibody titres were
    significantly enhanced compared to the standard interval
    group.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Neutralizing antibody responses were excellent and
    comparable in both groups.&amp;nbsp;A slight decrease in Spike-specific
    polyfunctional CD4+ T-cells expressing interferon-γ and IL-2 as well as
    monofunctional CD4+ T-cells was seen in the delayed group.&amp;nbsp;Both
    polyfunctional and monofunctional CD8+ T-cell responses were
    comparable.&amp;nbsp;Our data suggest that the strategy of delayed second
    dose mRNA vaccination is not overtly detrimental, and specifically may lead
    to an enhanced humoral immune response.

  abstract: >-
    Although clinical trials and real-world studies have affirmed the
    effectiveness and safety of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, reports of
    breakthrough infections and persistent emergence of new variants highlight
    the need to vigilantly monitor the effectiveness of these vaccines. Here we
    compare the effectiveness of two full-length Spike protein-encoding mRNA
    vaccines from Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) in the Mayo
    Clinic Health System over time from January to July 2021, during which
    either the Alpha or Delta variant was highly prevalent. We defined cohorts
    of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each)
    matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date
    of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study
    period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81-90.6%;
    BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69-81%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization
    (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81-97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73-93%). In July,
    vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273:
    81%, 95% CI: 33-96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24-93.9%), but effectiveness
    against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI:
    58-87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13-62%), with a more pronounced reduction for
    BNT162b2. Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from
    0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence
    decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of
    infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus
    BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states
    (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a
    two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2
    (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing
    its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full
    vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination
    with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62). Our observational study
    highlights that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly protect against
    infection and severe disease, further evaluation of mechanisms underlying
    differences in their effectiveness such as dosing regimens and vaccine
    composition are warranted.

    neutralizing antibody levels elicited by a single-dose Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010
    viral particles [vp]) primary regimen and booster doses (5x1010 vp and
    1.25x1010 vp) were assessed by ELISA and wild-type VNA in sera from
    participants in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial (Cohort 1a, 18–55 years old,
    N=25; Cohort 2a, 18–55 years old boosted at 6 months, N=17; Cohort 3, ≥65
    years old, N=22) and a Phase 2 clinical trial (18–55 and ≥65-year old
    participants boosted at 6 months, total N=73). Neutralizing antibody levels
    were determined approximately 8 months after the primary vaccination in
    participants aged 18–55 years and approximately 9 months in participants
    aged ≥65 years. Binding antibody levels were evaluated 6 months after
    primary vaccination and 7- and 28-days after booster doses in both age
    groups. Results: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S elicited neutralizing
    antibodies that remained largely stable for approximately 8–9 months and
    binding antibodies that remained stable for at least 6 months irrespective
    of age group. A 5x1010 vp booster dose at 6 months post prime vaccination in
    18–55-year-old adults elicited a steep and robust 9-fold increase at Day 7
    post boost compared to Day 29 levels following the initial immunization. A
    lower booster dose of 1.25x1010 vp at 6 months in adults 18–55 and ≥65 years
    of age also elicited a rapid and high increase of 6–7.7 fold at Day 28 post
    boost compared to Day 29 levels following the initial immunization, with
    similar magnitude of post-boost responses in both age groups. Conclusions: A
    single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, which demonstrated protection in a Phase 3
    efficacy trial, elicited durable neutralizing and binding antibodies for at
    least 8 and 6 months, respectively, in adults >18 years of age at levels
    similar to Day 29 responses. A 5x1010 vp or 1.25x1010 vp booster dose at 6
    months elicited rapid and robust increases in spike binding antibody levels.
    The anamnestic responses after booster immunization imply robust immune
    memory elicited by single-dose Ad26.COV2.S.

    The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of concern is expanding globally.
    Here, we assess real-world effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)
    and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines against this variant in the population of
    Qatar, using a matched test-negative, case- control study design. BNT162b2
    effectiveness against any Delta infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, was
    64.2% (95% CI: 38.1-80.1%) ≥14 days after the first dose and before the
    second dose, but was only 53.5% (95% CI: 43.9-61.4%) ≥14 days after the
    second dose, in a population in which a large proportion of fully vaccinated
    persons received their second dose several months earlier. Corresponding
    effectiveness measures for mRNA-1273 were 79.0% (95% CI: 58.9-90.1%) and
    84.8% (95% CI: 75.9-90.8%), respectively. Effectiveness against any severe,
    critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to Delta was 89.7% (95% CI:
    61.0-98.1%) for BNT162b2 and 100.0% (95% CI: 41.2-100.0%) for mRNA-1273, ≥14
    days after the second dose. Both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are highly effective
    in preventing Delta hospitalization and death, but less so in preventing
    infection, particularly for BNT162b2.

    Machine learning solves RNA puzzles

    RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional shapes that are difficult
    to determine experimentally or predict computationally. Understanding these
    structures may aid in the discovery of drugs for currently untreatable
    diseases. Townshend et al. introduced a machine-learning method that
    significantly improves prediction of RNA structures (see the Perspective by
    Weeks). Most other recent advances in deep learning have required a
    tremendous amount of data for training. The fact that this method succeeds
    given very little training data suggests that related methods could address
    unsolved problems in many fields where data are scarce.

    Science, abe5650, this issue p. 1047; see also abk1971, p. 964

    RNA molecules adopt three-dimensional structures that are critical to their
    function and of interest in drug discovery. Few RNA structures are known,
    however, and predicting them computationally has proven challenging. We
    introduce a machine learning approach that enables identification of
    accurate structural models without assumptions about their defining
    characteristics, despite being trained with only 18 known RNA structures.
    The resulting scoring function, the Atomic Rotationally Equivariant Scorer
    (ARES), substantially outperforms previous methods and consistently produces
    the best results in community-wide blind RNA structure prediction
    challenges. By learning effectively even from a small amount of data, our
    approach overcomes a major limitation of standard deep neural networks.
    Because it uses only atomic coordinates as inputs and incorporates no
    RNA-specific information, this approach is applicable to diverse problems in
    structural biology, chemistry, materials science, and beyond.

    A machine learning method significantly improves scoring of RNA structural
    models, despite being trained on very few structures.

    <h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2)
    variant was first detected in England in March, 2021. It has since rapidly
    become the predominant lineage, owing to high transmissibility. It is
    suspected that the delta variant is associated with more severe disease than
    the previously dominant alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. We aimed to characterise
    the severity of the delta variant compared with the alpha variant by
    determining the relative risk of hospital attendance
    outcomes.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>This cohort study was done among all
    patients with COVID-19 in England between March 29 and May 23, 2021, who
    were identified as being infected with either the alpha or delta SARS-CoV-2
    variant through whole-genome sequencing. Individual-level data on these
    patients were linked to routine health-care datasets on vaccination,
    emergency care attendance, hospital admission, and mortality (data from
    Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System and
    COVID-19-associated deaths dataset; the National Immunisation Management
    System; and NHS Digital Secondary Uses Services and Emergency Care Data
    Set). The risk for hospital admission and emergency care attendance were
    compared between patients with sequencing-confirmed delta and alpha variants
    for the whole cohort and by vaccination status subgroups. Stratified Cox
    regression was used to adjust for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, recent
    international travel, area of residence, calendar week, and vaccination
    status.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Individual-level data on 43 338
    COVID-19-positive patients (8682 with the delta variant, 34 656 with the
    alpha variant; median age 31 years \[IQR 17–43]) were included in our
    analysis. 196 (2·3%) patients with the delta variant versus 764 (2·2%)
    patients with the alpha variant were admitted to hospital within 14 days
    after the specimen was taken (adjusted hazard ratio \[HR] 2·26 \[95% CI
    1·32–3·89]). 498 (5·7%) patients with the delta variant versus 1448 (4·2%)
    patients with the alpha variant were admitted to hospital or attended
    emergency care within 14 days (adjusted HR 1·45 \[1·08–1·95]). Most patients
    were unvaccinated (32 078 \[74·0%] across both groups). The HRs for
    vaccinated patients with the delta variant versus the alpha variant
    (adjusted HR for hospital admission 1·94 \[95% CI 0·47–8·05] and for
    hospital admission or emergency care attendance 1·58 \[0·69–3·61]) were
    similar to the HRs for unvaccinated patients (2·32 \[1·29–4·16] and 1·43
    \[1·04–1·97]; p=0·82 for both) but the precision for the vaccinated subgroup
    was low.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>This large national study found a
    higher hospital admission or emergency care attendance risk for patients
    with COVID-19 infected with the delta variant compared with the alpha
    variant. Results suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated
    populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care services than the
    alpha variant.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Medical Research Council; UK Research

    Mechanisms of airborne transmission

    The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted controversies and unknowns about how
    respiratory pathogens spread between hosts. Traditionally, it was thought
    that respiratory pathogens spread between people through large droplets
    produced in coughs and through contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites).
    However, several respiratory pathogens are known to spread through small
    respiratory aerosols, which can float and travel in air flows, infecting
    people who inhale them at short and long distances from the infected person.
    Wang et al. review recent advances in understanding airborne transmission
    gained from studying the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
    coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and other respiratory pathogens. The
    authors suggest that airborne transmission may be the dominant form of
    transmission for several respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, and
    that further understanding of the mechanisms underlying infection from the
    airborne route will better inform mitigation measures.

    Structured Abstract

    BACKGROUNDExposure to droplets produced in the coughs and sneezes of
    infected individuals or contact with droplet-contaminated surfaces (fomites)
    have been widely perceived as the dominant transmission modes for
    respiratory pathogens. Airborne transmission is traditionally defined as
    involving the inhalation of infectious aerosols or “droplet nuclei” smaller
    than 5 μm and mainly at a distance of >1 to 2 m away from the infected
    individual, and such transmission has been thought to be relevant only for
    “unusual” diseases. However, there is robust evidence supporting the
    airborne transmission of many respiratory viruses, including severe acute
    respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory
    syndrome (MERS)–CoV, influenza virus, human rhinovirus, and respiratory
    syncytial virus (RSV). The limitations of traditional views of droplet,
    fomite, and airborne transmission were illuminated during the COVID-19
    pandemic. Droplet and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 alone cannot account
    for the numerous superspreading events and differences in transmission
    between indoor and outdoor environments observed during the COVID-19
    pandemic. Controversy surrounding how COVID-19 is transmitted and what
    interventions are needed to control the pandemic has revealed a critical
    need to better understand the airborne transmission pathway of respiratory
    viruses, which will allow for better-informed strategies to mitigate the
    transmission of respiratory infections.

    ADVANCESRespiratory droplets and aerosols can be generated by various
    expiratory activities. Advances in aerosol measurement techniques, such as
    aerodynamic and scanning mobility particle sizing, have shown that the
    majority of exhaled aerosols are smaller than 5 μm, and a large fraction are
    <1 μm for most respiratory activities, including those produced during
    breathing, talking, and coughing. Exhaled aerosols occur in multiple size
    modes that are associated with different generation sites and production
    mechanisms in the respiratory tract. Although 5 μm has been used
    historically to distinguish aerosols from droplets, the size distinction
    between aerosols and droplets should be 100 μm, which represents the largest
    particle size that can remain suspended in still air for more than 5 s from
    a height of 1.5 m, typically reach a distance of 1 to 2 m from the emitter
    (depending on the velocity of airflow carrying the aerosols), and can be
    inhaled. Aerosols produced by an infected individual may contain infectious
    viruses, and studies have shown that viruses are enriched in small aerosols
    (<5 μm). The transport of virus-laden aerosols is affected by the
    physicochemical properties of aerosols themselves and environmental factors,
    including temperature, relative humidity, ultraviolet radiation, airflow,
    and ventilation. Once inhaled, virus-laden aerosols can deposit in different
    parts of the respiratory tract. Larger aerosols tend to be deposited in the
    upper airway; however, smaller aerosols, although they can also be deposited
    there, can penetrate deep into the alveolar region of the lungs. The strong
    effect of ventilation on transmission, the distinct difference between
    indoor and outdoor transmission, well-documented long-range transmission,
    the observed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 despite the use of masks and eye
    protection, the high frequency of indoor superspreading events of
    SARS-CoV-2, animal experiments, and airflow simulations provide strong and
    unequivocal evidence for airborne transmission. Fomite transmission of
    SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be far less efficient, and droplets are only
    dominant when individuals are within 0.2 m of each other when talking.
    Although both aerosols and droplets can be produced by infected individuals
    during expiratory activities, droplets fall quickly to the ground or
    surfaces within seconds, leaving an enrichment of aerosols over droplets.
    The airborne pathway likely contributes to the spread of other respiratory
    viruses whose transmission was previously characterized as droplet driven.
    The World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC) have officially acknowledged the inhalation of
    virus-laden aerosols as a main transmission mode in spreading COVID-19 at
    both short and long ranges in 2021.

    OUTLOOKAirborne transmission of pathogens has been vastly underappreciated,
    mostly because of an insufficient understanding about the airborne behavior
    of aerosols and at least partially because of the misattribution of
    anecdotal observations. Given the lack of evidence for droplet and fomite
    transmission and the increasingly strong evidence for aerosols in
    transmitting numerous respiratory viruses, we must acknowledge that airborne
    transmission is much more prevalent than previously recognized. Given all
    that we have learned about SARS-CoV-2 infection, the aerosol transmission
    pathway needs to be reevaluated for all respiratory infectious diseases.
    Additional precautionary measures must be implemented for mitigating aerosol
    transmission at both short and long ranges, with particular attention to
    ventilation, airflows, air filtration, UV disinfection, and mask fit. These
    interventions are critical tools for ending the current pandemic and
    preventing future outbreaks. <img class="fragment-image"

    in airborne transmission of respiratory viruses.Virus-laden aerosols (<100
    I1/4m) are first generated by an infected individual through expiratory
    activities, through which they are exhaled and transported in the
    environment. They may be inhaled by a potential host to initiate a new
    infection, provided that they remain infectious. In contrast to droplets
    (>100 I1/4m), aerosols can linger in air for hours and travel beyond 1 to 2
    m from the infected individual who exhales them, causing new infections at
    both short and long ranges.CREDIT: N. CARY/SCIENCE

    The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed critical knowledge gaps in our
    understanding of and a need to update the traditional view of transmission
    pathways for respiratory viruses. The long-standing definitions of droplet
    and airborne transmission do not account for the mechanisms by which
    virus-laden respiratory droplets and aerosols travel through the air and
    lead to infection. In this Review, we discuss current evidence regarding the
    transmission of respiratory viruses by aerosols—how they are generated,
    transported, and deposited, as well as the factors affecting the relative
    contributions of droplet-spray deposition versus aerosol inhalation as modes
    of transmission. Improved understanding of aerosol transmission brought
    about by studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
    (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires a reevaluation of the major transmission
    pathways for other respiratory viruses, which will allow better-informed
    controls to reduce airborne transmission.

    A Review discusses the scientific basis of and factors controlling airborne
    transmission of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses.

  abstract: >-
    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
    causative agent of a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
    that has led to more than 3 million deaths worldwide. Safe and effective
    vaccines are now available, including the mRNA-1273 prototype vaccine, which
    encodes for the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein stabilized in the
    prefusion conformation by 2 proline substitutions. This vaccine showed 94%
    efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical
    study. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, some of which have shown
    decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibody, most
    notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy
    remains to be determined. In addition, recent evidence of waning antibody
    levels after infection or vaccination point to the need for periodic
    boosting of immunity. Here we present the preliminary evaluation of a
    clinical study on the use of the prototype mRNA-1273 or modified COVID-19
    mRNA vaccines, designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as booster
    vaccines in participants previously vaccinated approximately 6 months
    earlier with two doses of the prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273. The modified
    vaccines include a monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encoding for the S protein found
    in the B.1.351 variant and multivalent mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of
    mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. As single 50 µg booster vaccinations, both
    mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 had acceptable safety profiles and were
    immunogenic. Antibody neutralization titers against B.1.351 and P.1 variants
    measured by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays before the
    booster vaccinations, approximately 6 to 8 months after the primary series,
    were low or below the assay limit of quantification, although geometric mean
    titers versus the wild-type strain remained above levels likely to be
    protective. Two weeks after the booster vaccinations, titers against the
    wild-type original strain, B.1.351, and P.1 variants increased to levels
    similar to or higher than peak titers after the primary series vaccinations.
    Although both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 boosted neutralization of the
    wild-type original strain, and B.1.351 and P.1 variants, mRNA-1273.351
    appeared to be more effective at increasing neutralization of the B.1.351
    virus versus a boost with mRNA-1273. The vaccine trial is ongoing and
    boosting of clinical trial participants with the multivalent mRNA-1273.211
    is currently being evaluated.
